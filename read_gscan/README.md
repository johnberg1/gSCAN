# TL;DR
This file reads a fully specified gSCAN dataset into a representation that can be processed by numerical models.
 
Unzip one of the data folders in `../data`, e.g. `compositional_splits`, or use the demo dataset (`../data/demo_dataset/dataset.txt`).
 
To obtain the parsed dataset in a file named "parsed_dataset.txt", run:
```bash
>>> python -m pip install numpy
>>> python read_gscan.py --dataset_path=../data/compositional_splits/dataset.txt --save_data --output_file=parsed_dataset.txt
```

Another possibility is to import the function `data_loader` in another project and use the data directly in a model.

# Prelims
```python -m pip install numpy```

NB: if you want to load `./data/compositional_splits/dataset.txt` note that it is 2 GB.

# Load grounded SCAN data set.
Specify the path to the `dataset.txt` file as argument `--dataset_path`.

If you want to save the dataset in a new file with parsed situation representation, set the flag `--save_data`.

# Background information

In `./data/compositional_splits/dataset.txt` the situation of each data example is represented sparsely,
meaning a list of placed objects is saved as opposed to the full grid size by grid size grid.
This code parses that representation back into a grid that can be used by computational models.

Each grid cell in a situation is fully specified by a vector of size 15.
The first 10 dimensions specify the object (if there is one). The first 4 of those is a one-hot vector
specifying the size of the object (so [0 0 1 0] for size 3), the second 3 dimensions specify
the object color (e.g. [0 1 0] for green), then the shape ([0 1 0] for a square).

Finally the last five dimensions specify the agent (at the cell it is currently):
The first dimension is 1 if there's an agent, 0 if not, the last four dimensions specify the
direction the agent is looking in ([1 0 0 0] fo east).

**Dimensions**:

[size 1, size 2, size 3, size 4, circle, square, cylinder, green, red, yellow, blue, agent, east, south, west, north]

# Demonstration

To get a feel of the data used in the paper, we can look at the data in the folder `../data/demo_dataset/..`. This dataset is highly simplified in terms of grid size, vocabulary, and number of examples, but the ideas are the same. When opening `../data/demo_dataset/dataset.txt` we can see that the first example if we follow the keys "examples" and "situational_1" is the following:

This data example contains the *"command"*, or input  instruction, 'walk to the red circle', which, combined with the world state, maps to the *"target_commands"*: "turn left,turn left,walk,turn left,walk". The example contains the situation representation, or world state, at the key *"situation"*, and also contains additional information that is needed when parsing the data back to the representation it was generated from, namely the *"derivation"* containing the depth-first extracted constituency tree. The *"meaning"* represents the semantic meaning of the input instruction. This is only useful when we generate the benchmark with nonsensical words, in which case we need a semantic representation that can be understood by humans. 

This example is visualized by the following animation:

The parsed data only retains the important keys for training a computational model, namely the input pair *"input"* and *"situation"*, and the target sequence *"target"*. The situation representation is instead of a sparse representation of the available objects represented by the, in this case, 4 x 4 x 15 sized matrix of the grid world, where the 15 dimensions are the following:

[size 1, size 2, size 3, size 4, circle, square, red, green, yellow, blue, agent, east, south, west, north]

In the vector at the matrix of *"situation"* position (1, 1), you can see the representation of the green square of size 4 in row 1 and column 1 (starting from 0) of the world. Namely the following vector: `[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`. In this example above (the representation from `dataset.txt` as opposed to the one in `parsed_dataset.txt`) this vector can be found at the key *"placed_objects"*, *"3"*, *"vector"*: `0001010100`, which represents the first 10 dimensions of the other vector, and is the representation without the agent represented.
